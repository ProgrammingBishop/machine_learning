# Blizzard Entertainment Market Segmentation using Tweepy Library (Still in Progress)
#### On hiatus for completion due to current obligations

## TODO

- Final refactoring of application. This includes possibly simplifying functions, possibly creating new functions, possibly implementing more efficient processes to replace naive ones, etc.
- Append k - k dependent on optimal segments - additional features to the user sparse matrix. These features will be the category in which a user describes themself in the descriptor data. These categories will be generated via topic modeling.
- Perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling/distribution using Blizzard Entertainment's tweets.
- Perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling/distribution using the follower's tweets as they relate to Blizzard Entertainment. 
- Write a report that offers an overview of Blizzard Entertainment, the application, the purpose of the application, the questions the application aims to answer, the answers found in this analysis as well as statistical significance (as this is a small sample of Blizzard's follower base), and short comings or future updates to that can bring more effectiveness to this analysis and application.

#### By leveraging this information, the following questions can be explored further:

- Who do followers of Blizzard Entertainment tend to also follow? This would be valuable information to a company to know if there are other products, enterprises, or celebrities they can reach out to for endorsement.
- What products of Blizzard Entertainment are followed? Which are popular or not so popular? This will give a company an idea of what is working, what is not working, and possibly strategies to reallocate revenue to enhance marketing in the areas that require it.
- Can the other users that Blizzard Entertainment's followers also follow be categorized by industry? Are they related to the gaming industry?
- Are there competitors based on who users also follow? If so are they similar or different to Blizzard Entertainment? This will enable a company to evaluate what they are doing differently that could be causing less effective approaches, what they can be doing better, or what they are already being successful in.
- How does the market diversify between segments? Are there similar interests or disinterests between segments?
